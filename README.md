# Tracalorie

## Description

This is a refactoring of the Tracalorie project from Brad Traversy's 2023 Modern JavaScript from the Beginning Second Edition course on O'Reilly. I added a Bootswatch theme selector and also switched from using Local Storage to the JSON-Server NPM package.

## Note

This project requires the JSON-Server NPM package, which can be installed by running

### npm install

and started by running

### npm run server

Be sure to copy the contents of

### db.json.bak

into a new

### db.json

before starting the JSON server.
